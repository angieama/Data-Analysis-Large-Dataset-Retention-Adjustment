# Data-Analysis-Large-Dataset-Retention-Adjustment
This VBA macro updates "Retention" values in Excel files across subfolders. It prompts for a new value, searches column C for "Retention", and updates the adjacent cell in column D if numeric. Handles merged cells, logs changes, and saves originals. Optimized for performance with disabled updates. Ideal for bulk data.
